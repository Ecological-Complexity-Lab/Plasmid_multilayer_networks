# Shapiro_etal_Plasmid_Networks
Data and scripts to carry out all analysis in Shapiro et al., "Multilayer Networks of Plasmid Genetic Similarity Reveal Potential Pathways of Gene Transmission"

All scripts tested for R version 4.1.1

This repository contains all files needed to run analysis on plasmid rumen networks. To begin, download and unzip the StartingFiles.zip folder and run analyses sequentially starting with script 01_Initial_data_processing.

Scripts can be started independently using the Rdata saved in the Rdata_Intermediate_files.zip folder.
